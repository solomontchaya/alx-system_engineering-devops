# Shell Initialization, Expansions, and Variables

This project covers essential shell concepts including expansions, shell arithmetic, variables, initialization files, aliases, and technical writing. The goal is to understand how the shell environment works and how to customize it effectively.

## Learning Objectives

### General
- Understand what happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt`
- Master shell initialization files and their purposes

### Shell Initialization Files
- Explain `/etc/profile` file and `/etc/profile.d` directory
- Understand the purpose of `~/.bashrc` file

### Variables
- Differentiate between local and global variables
- Understand reserved variables and their roles
- Create, update, and delete shell variables
- Explain the roles of reserved variables: `HOME`, `PATH`, `PS1`
- Understand special parameters and `$?`

### Expansions
- Use expansions effectively
- Differentiate between single and double quotes
- Perform command substitution with `$()` and backticks

### Shell Arithmetic
- Perform arithmetic operations within the shell

### The alias Command
- Create, list, and temporarily disable aliases

### Other Help Pages
- Execute commands from a file in the current shell

## Requirements

- All scripts must be exactly two lines long
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all scripts: `#!/bin/bash`
- Not allowed to use: `&&`, `||`, `;`, `bc`, `sed`, or `awk`
- All files must be executable
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Project Structure

Each script in this project demonstrates a specific concept related to shell initialization, expansions, variables, or aliases. The scripts are designed to be minimal yet effective in illustrating the core concepts.

## Important Notes

- Read and understand `/etc/profile`, `/etc/inputrc`, and `~/.bashrc`
- Explore files in `/etc/profile.d` directory
- Focus on understanding rather than memorization
- All work must be original - no plagiarism allowed

This project will help you master fundamental shell concepts that are essential for effective command-line usage and shell scripting.
